He has restored my soul: He has guided me into the paths of righteousness, for His name's sake. Even if I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I shall not fear evil things, for You are with me: Your rod and Your staff, these comfort me.

                    I will exalt You, O Lord; for You have accepted me, and not caused my enemies to rejoice over me. O Lord, my God, I cried to You, and You have healed me. O Lord, You have brought up my soul from Hades, You have delivered me from the hands of those who will go down to the pit.

                    Sing to the Lord, all you His saints, and confess the remembrance of His holiness. For anger is in His wrath, but life in His favor: weeping shall be for the evening, but joy shall be in the morning.

To You, O Lord, I shall cry; and to my God I shall make supplication. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Shall the dust confess to You? or shall it declare Your truth?

                    The Lord heard, and had mercy upon me; the Lord became to me a helper.

                    I sought the Lord diligently, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fear. Draw near to Him, and be enlightened: and your faces shall not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round about those who fear Him, and will deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is sweet: blessed is the man who hopes in Him. Fear the Lord, all you His saints: for there is no want to those who fear Him. The rich have become poor and they hungered: but those who seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.

Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile. Turn away from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are bent to their prayer: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to wipe out their memorial from upon the earth.

                    The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them, and delivered them out of all their afflictions. The Lord is near to those who are contrite in their heart; and will save the lowly in spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but out of them all the Lord will deliver them. The Lord will keep all their bones: not one of them shall be broken. The death of the sinners is evil: and those who hate righteousness will grieve. The Lord will save the souls of His servants: and none of those who hope in Him shall grieve. ALLELUIA.

                    I said, O Lord, have mercy on me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against You. My enemies have spoken evil against me, saying, “When shall he die, and his name perish?” And if he came to see me, he spoke in vanity; and his heart gathered unto him iniquity; he went forth and spoke in like manner. All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised evil. They denounced a wicked word against me, saying, “Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again?” For even the man of my peace, he whom I trusted, who ate my bread, lifted up his heel against me.

                    But you, O Lord, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, and I shall compensate them. In this I knew that You were delighted in me, because my enemy shall not rejoice over me. But because of my innocence You accepted me, and have established me before You forever. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. So be it, so be it. ALLELUIA.

Surround us by Your holy angels, that, by their camp, we may be guarded and guided, and attain the unity of faith, and the knowledge of Your imperceptible and infinite glory.
