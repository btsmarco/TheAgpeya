Declare His glory among the Gentiles, and His wonders among all peoples. For the Lord is great, and greatly praised: He is fearful above all the gods. For all the gods of the nations are devils, but the Lord made the heavens. Majesty and splendor are before Him: holiness and great beauty are in His Holy.

                            Bring to the Lord, O the families of the Gentiles, bring to the Lord glory and honor. Bring to the Lord the glory of His name: carry offerings, and go into His court. Worship the Lord in His holy court: let all the earth tremble before His face. Say among the nations, “The Lord reigned on a wood: for He has established the world that it shall not be moved: He will judge the peoples in righteousness.”

                            Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult; let the sea be moved: and its fullness. The plains shall rejoice, and all things in them: then all the trees of the forest shall exult before the face of the Lord: for He is coming to judge the earth; He will judge the world in justice, and the peoples with His truth.

Fire shall precede Him, and with a flame shall burn up His enemies who surround Him. His lightings lightened the world; the earth saw, and trembled. The mountains melted like wax before the face of the Lord, before the face of the Lord of the whole earth. The heavens have declared His righteousness, and all the peoples have seen His glory.

                            All those who worship graven images and boast in their idols shall be ashamed. Worship Him all you His angels.

                            Zion heard and rejoiced; and the daughters of Judea exulted, because of Your judgements, O Lord. For You are Lord most high over all the earth; You are greatly exalted above all the gods.

                            You who love the Lord, hate evil; the Lord preserves the souls of His saints; He will deliver them from the hands of the sinners. Light has shined for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in their heart. Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous; and praise the remembrance of His holiness. ALLELUIA.

Sing to the Lord with a harp, with a harp and a voice of psalm, with directed trumpets, and a sound of a trumpet of horn. Shout joyfully before the Lord King.
