									When I cried out, God of my righteousness heard me: in tribulation You have made room for me; have compassion upon me, O Lord, and hear my prayer.
									
									O you, sons of men, how long will your hearts be heavy? Why do you love vanity, and seek falsehood? Know you that the Lord has made His Holy One wondrous. The Lord hears me when I cry to Him. Be angry, and do not sin; feel sorrow upon your beds for what you say in your hearts. Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord.
									
									Many say, Who can show us the good things? The light of Your countenance, O Lord, has been shined upon us. You have given gladness to my heart: they have been multiplied with the fruit of their wheat and wine and oil. I shall both lie down in peace and sleep: for You alone, O Lord, have caused me to dwell in hope. ALLELUIA.

But You, O Lord, how long? Return, deliver my soul: revive me for the sake of Your mercy. For in death there is no one who is remembering You: and in Hades who is able to confess to You? I became wearied in my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I shall wet my couch with my tears. My eye is troubled beΣause of anger; I have grown old because of all my enemies.

Though an army should fight me, my heart shall not be afraid: though war should rise up against me, in this I am confident.
									
									One thing I have asked of the Lord, this also I will seek, that I should dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, that I should behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and visit His holy temple. For in the day of my afflictions He hid me in His tabernacle: He sheltered me in the secret of His tabernacle; He set me up on a rock. And now, behold, He has lifted up my head over my enemies: I went round and offered in His tabernacle a sacrifice of joy; I shall sing, and sing psalms to the Lord.
									
									Hear, O Lord, my voice which I have uttered aloud: have mercy on me, and hearken to me. For You are He to whom my heart said, ԉ have sought Your face: Your face, O Lord, I will seek.ԠDo not turn away Your face from me, do not reject Your servant in anger: be a helper to me, and do not forsake me; and do not overlook me, O God my Savior.

Do not deliver me over to the souls of those who afflict me; for unΪust witnesses have risen up against me, and injustice has lied to itself.

									Many times they have warred against me from my youth, let Israel now say. Many times they have warred against me from my youth, and yet they have not prevailed against me. The sinners scourged me on my back, and prolonged their iniquity. The Lord is righteous; He has broken the necks of sinners. Let all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned back. Let them be as the grass of the house-tops, which withers before it is plucked up, with which the reaper does not fill his hand, nor he who gathers up sheaves, his bosom.

									Lord, remember David and all his meekness: how he swore to the Lord, and vowed to the God of Jacob, saying, ԉ will not go into the dwelling of my house, or go up to the bed of my couch; I will not give sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids, nor rest to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, and a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. Behold, we heard of it in Ephratha; we found it in the fields of the wood. Let us enter into His dwelling, and worship at the place where His feet stood.
									
									Arise, O Lord, into Your rest; You, and the ark of Your holy place. Your priests shall clothe themselves with righteousness; and Your righteous shall exult. For the sake of Your servant David, do not turn away Your face from Your anointed.
									
									The Lord has sworn in truth to David, and He will not turn from it, ԏf the fruit of your loins I will set upon your throne. If your children keep My covenant and My testimonies which I will teach them, their children also will sit upon your throne forever.ԍ
									
									For the Lord has selected Zion, He has chosen her a dwelling for Himself: Ԕhis is My resting place forever. Here I will dwell; for I have desired it. In blessing I shall bless her hunting. Her poor I shall satisfy with bread. Her priests I shall clothe with salvation; and her saints with rejoicing shall rejoice. There I shall raise a horn to David. I have prepared a lamp for My anointed. His enemies I shall clothe with shame, and My holiness shall flourish upon Him.ԠALLELUIA.

									By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept when we remembered Zion. We hung our harps on the willows in the midst of it. For there those who had taken us captive asked of us the words of a song; and those who had carried us away asked a hymn, saying, ԓing us one of the songs of Zion.ԍ
									
									How will we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? If I forget you, O Jerusalem, I shall forget my right hand. My tongue shall cling to my throat, if I did not remember you; if I did not prefer Jerusalem as the head of my joy.
									
									Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Ԕear it down, tear it down, even to its foundations.ԠWretched daughter of Babylon!

									O Lord, I have cried to You, hear me. Attend to the voice of my supplication when I cry to You. Let my prayer be set forth before You as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice. O Lord, set a watch on my mouth and a strong door for my lips. Do not incline my heart to words of evil, to employ excuses for sins with men who work iniquity; and I shall not agree with their choices. The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me: but do not let the oil of the sinner anoint my head: for yet my prayer also is in their pleasures.
									
									Their mighty ones have been swallowed up near the rock: they shall hear my words, for they are delightful. As a lump of earth, they are broken upon the ground, their bones have been scattered at Hades. For my eyes are to You, O Lord: O Lord, I have hoped in You; do not take away my soul. Keep me from the snare which they have set for me, and from the stumbling blocks of those who work iniquity. Sinners shall fall by their own net: I am alone until iniquity passes by. ALLELUIA.

									Look upon my humiliation, and save me: for I have not forgotten Your law. Plead my cause, and redeem me: revive me for the sake of Your word. Salvation is far from sinners: for they have not searched out Your ordinances. Your mercies, O Lord, are many: revive me according to Your judgments. Many are they who persecute me and distress me: but I did not turn away from Your testimonies. I beheld foolish men, and I suffered; for they did not keep Your words. Behold, O Lord, I have loved Your commandments: revive me in Your mercy. The beginning of Your words is truth; and all judgments of Your righteousness are forever.
