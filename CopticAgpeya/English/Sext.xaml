                            The prayer of the sixth hour of the blessed day, we offer to Christ our King and our God, beseeching Him to forgive us our sins.

                            From the Psalms of our father David the prophet and the king, may his blessings be upon us all. Amen.

                            Save me, O God, by Your name, and judge me by Your power. O God, hear my prayer; hearken to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my soul: they have not set God before them.

                            For behold, God helped me; and the Lord is the protector of my soul. He shall return the evil things to my enemies; utterly wipe them out by Your truth. I will willingly sacrifice to You: I will confess Your name, O Lord; for it isgood. For You have delivered me out of every affliction, and my eye has looked down upon my enemies. ALLELUIA.

I will cry to God Most High; God who has benefitted me. He sent from heaven and saved me; He gave over to reproach those who trampled on me: God has sent forth His mercy and His truth; and He has delivered my soul from the midst of young lions: I laid down to sleep, while troubled. As for the sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

                            Be You exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the earth. They have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before me, and fallen into it.

                            My heart, O God, is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing, and chant in my glory. Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp: I will rise early. O Lord, I will confess You among the peoples: I will sing to You among the nations. For Your mercy has been magnified up to the heavens, and Your truth up to the clouds. Be You exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the earth. ALLELUIA.

I shall dwell in Your dwelling place forever; I shall be sheltered under the shadow of Your wings.

                            For You, O God, have heard my prayers; You have given an inheritance to those who fear Your name. Days upon days of the king, You shall lengthen his years to all generations. He shall endure forever before God. As for His mercy and truth, who will be able to seek them out?

So I will bless You during my life: I will lift up my hands in Your name. My soul shall be filled as with marrow and fatness; and lips of joy shall praise Your name.

                            I have remembered You on my bed: in the time of early morning I have usually meditated on You.

For, the sparrow has found for himself a home, and the turtledove for herself a nest, where she may lay her young; Your altars, O Lord, God of hosts, my King, and my God.

Blessed is the man whose help is from You, O Lord; he sets paths upward in his heart in the valley of weeping, in the place which he has appointed, for there the Law-Giver will grant blessings. They shall go from strength to strength: the God of gods shall be revealed in Zion.

                            O Lord, God of hosts, hear my prayer: hearken, O God of Jacob. Behold, O God our defender, and look upon the face of Your anointed. For one day in Your courts is better than thousands. I chose to throw myself down in the house of God, more than to dwell in the tents of the sinners. For the Lord God loves mercy and truth; He shall give grace and glory: the Lord shall not withhold good things from those who walk in innocence. O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man who hopes in You. ALLELUIA.

                            Turn us, O God of our salvation, and turn Your anger away from us. Would You be angry with us forever? Or will You extend Your wrath from generation to generation? O God, You shall turn back and revive us; and Your people shall rejoice in You. Show us Your mercy, O Lord, and grant us Your salvation.

Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from heaven. For the Lord shall give goodness; and our land shall yield its fruit. Righteousness shall go first before Him; and shall set His steps in the way. ALLELUIA.

                            O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and an assembly of violent men have sought my soul; and have not, at first, set You before them. But You, O Lord God, are compassionate and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy and true. Look down upon me, and have mercy on me: give strength to Your servant, and save the son of Your handmaid. Establish with me a sign for good; and let those who hate me see and be ashamed; because You, O Lord, have helped me, and comforted me. ALLELUIA.
