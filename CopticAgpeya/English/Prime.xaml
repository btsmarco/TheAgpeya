                            Why did the nations rage, and the peoples meditate on vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers ga­thered together against the Lord and against His Christ; saying, “Let us break through their bonds, and cast away their yoke from us.”

                            He who dwells in the heavens shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall mock them. Then He shall speak to them in His anger, and in His wrath He shall trouble them.

                            “But I have been established king by Him on Zion, His holy mountain, proclaiming the ordinance of the Lord: the Lord said to Me, `You are My Son, today I have begotten You. Ask Me, and I will give You the nations for Your inheritance, and Your authority to the end of the earth. You shall shepherd them with a rod of iron; You shall crush them as a potter's vessel.’ ”

                            Now, understand, O kings: be instructed, all you who judge the earth, serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in Him with trembling. Take hold of instruction, lest the Lord be angry, and you perish from the way of righteousness, whenever His wrath shall be suddenly kindled. Blessed are all who trust in Him. ALLELUIA.

In the morning You shall hear my voice: in the early morning I shall stand before You, and You will look upon me. For You are not a God who desires iniquity; nor shall he who works evil dwell in You; nor shall the transgressors abide before Your eyes: You have hated, O Lord, all who work iniquity. You will destroy all who speak falsehood. A man of blood and deceit the Lord abhors. But as for me, according to the multitude of Your mercy I shall enter Your house: I shall worship before Your holy temple in Your fear.

                            Guide me, O Lord, in Your righteousness; for the sake of my enemies, make my way straight before You. For in their mouth there is no truth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have done deceit. Judge them, O God; let them fall down in all their counsels: wipe them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; for they have provoked You, O Lord.

                            But let all who hope in You be glad: they shall rejoice for ever, and You shall dwell in them; and all who love Your name shall be proud in You. For You, O Lord, have blessed the righteous: as a shield of favor You have crowned us. ALLELUIA.

                            Keep me, O Lord; for I have hoped in You. I said to the Lord, “You are my Lord, and You have no need of my goodness.” He has manifested His wonders to His saints who are in His earth, and He has wrought all His desires in them. Their ailments have been multiplied who hastened after another God. I will not assemble their meetings of blood, nor make mention of their names with my lips. The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup. You are He who brings my inheritance back to me. The measuring lines have fallen to me among the best, and my inheritance is confirmed for me.

                            I will bless the Lord who has given me understanding; my reins too have instructed me even till the night. I foresaw the Lord always before me; He is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall live in hope: because You shall not leave my soul in Hades, neither shall You suffer Your holy One to see corruption. You have made known to me the ways of life; You will fill me with joy with Your face: delight is in Your right hand forever.  ALLELUIA.

                            The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims the work of His hands. Day to day utters speech, and night to night proclaims knowledge. There are no speeches or words, in which their voice is not heard. Their sound has gone out upon all the earth, and their words have reached to the ends of the world. In the sun He has set His dwelling; and it comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber: it shall exult as a giant running his course. Its going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and its goal is to the other end of heaven: and nothing will be hidden from its heat.

                            The law of the Lord is pure, converting souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, instructing the babes. The ordinances of the Lord are straight, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is a light, enlightening the eyes from afar. The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever and ever: the judgements of the Lord are true, and justified altogether. The desires of His heart are chosen more than gold and precious stone, and sweeter than honey and the honey-comb. For Your servant keeps them: and in keeping them there is great reward.

                            Who can understand transgressions? From my secret sins cleanse me, O Lord, and from the attack of strangers spare Your servant: if they do not have dominion over me, then I shall be blameless, and I shall be cleansed from great sin. All the sayings of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, shall be pleasing continually before You. O Lord; You are my helper, and my Savior. ALLELUIA.

For all who wait for You shall not be ashamed: let them be ashamed who wrought iniquity in vain. Show me Your ways, O Lord; and teach me Your paths. Lead me to Your truth, and teach me: for You are God my Savior: and for You I have waited the whole day. Remember, O Lord, Your compassions and Your mercies, for they exist from everlasting. The sins of my youth and those of my ignorance do not remember; and according to Your mercy remember me, for the sake of Your goodness, O Lord.

                            For good and upright is the Lord: therefore He shall set a law for those who sin in the way. He shall guide the meek in judgment. He shall teach the meek His ways. All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth to those who keep His covenant and His testimonies. For the sake of Your name, O Lord, You shall forgive my sin; for it is great.

                            Who is the man that fears the Lord? He shall set a law for him in the way which pleases Him. His soul shall dwell in good things; and his seed shall inherit the earth. The Lord is the strength of those who fear Him; and the name of the Lord is for those who revere Him, and His covenant He will manifest to them. My eyes are ever looking towards the Lord; for He will draw my feet out of the snare.

                            Look upon me, and have mercy on me; for I am an only child and poor. The afflictions of my heart have been multiplied; bring me out of my troubles. Behold my lowliness and my toil; and forgive all my sins. Look upon my enemies; for they have multiplied; and they have hated me with an unjust hatred. Keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me not be put to shame; for I have hoped in You. The harmless and upright joined themselves to me: for I waited for You, O Lord. Deliver Israel, O God, out of all his afflictions. ALLELUIA.

                            The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom will I fear? The Lord is the defender of my life; of whom will I be afraid? When the wicked drew near against me to eat up my flesh, those who distress me and my enemies, they fainted and fell. Though an army should fight me, my heart shall not be afraid: though war should rise up against me, in this I am confident.

                            One thing I have asked of the Lord, this also I will seek, that I should dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, that I should behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and visit His holy temple. For in the day of my afflictions He hid me in His tabernacle: He sheltered me in the secret of His tabernacle; He set me up on a rock. And now, behold, He has lifted up my head over my enemies: I went round and offered in His tabernacle a sacrifice of joy; I shall sing, and sing psalms to the Lord.

                            Hear, O Lord, my voice which I have uttered aloud: have mercy on me, and hearken to me. For You are He to whom my heart said, “I have sought Your face: Your face, O Lord, I will seek.” Do not turn away Your face from me, do not reject Your servant in anger: be a helper to me, and do not forsake me; and do not overlook me, O God my Savior. For my father and my mother have for­saken me, but the Lord has accepted me unto Himself. Set a law for me, O Lord, in Your ways, and guide me in a right path, because of my enemies. Do not deliver me over to the souls of those who afflict me; for un­just witnesses have risen up against me, and injustice has lied to itself. I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord: be of good cheer and let your heart be strengthened: and wait for the Lord. ALLELUIA.

                            In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness did not comprehend it.

                            There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not the Light, but was sent to bear witness to the Light. That was the true Light that gives light to every man coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world did not know Him. He came unto His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

                            And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of His Father, full of grace and truth. John bore witness of Him, and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, `He who comes after me is preferred before me: for He was before me.’ ” And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

                             Glory be to God forever. Amen.

We give thanks to You for Your great glory, O Lord, King of heaven, God the Father, the Almighty; O Lord, the one and Only-Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, Who takes away the sin of the world, have mercy on us. You, Who takes away the sin of the world, receive our prayers unto You. Who sits at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. You only are the Holy; You only are the Most High, Lord, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit; glory to God the Father. Amen.

                            Every day I will bless You, and praise Your holy name forever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

                            From the night season my soul awakes early unto You, O my God, for Your precepts are a light upon the earth. I was meditating on Your ways, for You have become a helper unto me. In the morning You shall hear my voice. Early I will stand before You, and You shall see me.
