                            Give thanks to the Lord; for He is good: for His mercy endures forever. Let now the house of Israel say that He is good: for His mercy endures forever. Let the house of Aaron say that He is good: for His mercy endures forever. Let now all who fear the Lord say that He is good: for His mercy endures forever.

                            I called on the Lord in my affliction: and He answered me, and brought me into a broad place. The Lord is my helper; and I shall not fear what man will do to me. The Lord is my helper; and I shall look down upon my own enemies. It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in man. It is better to hope in the Lord, than to hope in princes.

                            All the nations surrounded me: and in the name of the Lord I drove them away. They surrounded me and went around me: and in the name of the Lord I drove them away. They surrounded me as bees around a honeycomb, and they burst as fire among thorns: and in the name of the Lord I drove them away. I was pushed, that I might fall: but the Lord helped me. My strength and my praise is the Lord, and He has become unto me a salvation.

                            The voice of exultation and salvation is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of the Lord has wrought mightily. The right hand of the Lord has exalted me: the right hand of the Lord has wrought powerfully. I shall not die, but live, and recount the works of the Lord. With chastisement the Lord has chastened me: and has not given me up to death.

                            Open to me the gates of righteousness: that I will go into them, and praise the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it. I will praise You, O Lord, because You have answered me, and have become unto me a salvation. The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This has been done by the Lord; and it is wonderful in our eyes.

                            This is the day which the Lord has made: let us rejoice and be glad in it. O Lord, save us: O Lord, ease our ways. Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you from the house of the Lord. God the Lord has shined upon us: ordain a feast with those that reach the horns of the altar. You are my God, and I will give thanks to You: You are my God, and I will exalt You. I will give thanks to You, O Lord, for You have heard me, and have become unto me a salvation. Give thanks to the Lord; for He is good: for His mercy endures forever. ALLELUIA.

But, O merciful God, count me with the fellows of the eleventh hour. For, behold, in iniquities I was conceived, and in sins my mother bore me. Therefore, I do not dare to lift up my eyes to Heaven; but rather, I rely on the abundance of Your mercy and love for mankind, crying out and saying, “God, forgive me, a sinner, and have mercy on me.”

                            2.  Hasten, O Savior, to open to me the fatherly bosoms, for I wasted my life in pleasures and lusts, and the day has passed by me and vanished. Therefore, now I rely on the richness of Your never-ending compassion. So, then, do not forsake a submissive heart which is in need of your mercy. For unto You I cry, O Lord, humbly, “Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before You, and I am no longer worthy to be called Your son, so make me as one of Your hired servants.”

Therefore, prepare for me the ways of repentance, O Lady the Virgin; for to you I appeal, and through you I seek intercession, and upon you I call to help me, lest I might be put to shame. And when my soul departs my body attend to me, and defeat the conspiracy of the enemies, and shut the gates of Hades, lest they might swallow my soul, O you, blameless bride of the true Bridegroom.
